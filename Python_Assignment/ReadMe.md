2. **Searching and Sorting Techniques**: Implementing Linear Search, Binary Search, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
3. **Calculator Class**: Creating a class capable of finding the square and cube of a number.
4. **Programmer Class**: Creating a class to store information about programmers working at Microsoft.
5. **Matrix Multiplication**: Performing matrix multiplication.
6. **Comma-separated Numbers**: Accepting a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the console and generating a list and a tuple.
7. **Convert Hours to Seconds**: Writing a function that converts hours into seconds.
8. **HTTP Request Automation**: Automating the process of sending HTTP requests to a web server.
9. **Default Gateway Extraction**: Extracting the default gateway address from the output of `ifconfig` or `ipconfig`.
10. **Strong Password Generator**: Generating strong passwords of a specified length.
11. **CSV Data Cleaning**: Reading data from a CSV file and performing basic data cleaning operations.
12. **Pattern Search in Text Files**: Searching for specific patterns like email addresses or phone numbers in a text file.
13. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
14. **Bank Account Class**: Creating a class to represent a bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking the balance.
15. **File Manager GUI**: Creating a GUI-based file manager to browse directories and perform basic file operations.


## Getting Started


### Installing Guide

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harrysingh1908/Internship_Assignment.git
    cd Internship_Assignment
    ```


2. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
    Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


3. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Some programs require additional libraries. You can install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The `requirements.txt` file should contain:
    ```
    requests
    time
    subprocess
    re
    random
    string
    pandas
    tkinter
    shutil
    os
    ```

    
4. **Run the Programs**:
    - Navigate to the directory of the specific program.
    - Run the Python script using:
    ```bash
    python Program_.py
    ```
    Replace `Program_.py` with the name of the script you want to run.


### Feedback on the Assignment

This was a good assignment and very helpful. Dijkstra's algorithm and the GUI-based file manager were the toughest parts, but I was able to complete and learn from the rest of the tasks effectively. I would like to thank Albus Security for allowing me to have this opportunity to enhance my skills.
